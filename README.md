# FindMe

FindMe provides a sample for monitoring iBeacons. iBeacons can be added by specifying the UUID and Identifer
of the beacon device. Multiple iBeacons can be specified.
When the device running the app comes within range of a specified iBeacon, it's status will be 
updated in the table view and a local notification will be sent, displayed in the Notifications view.

If an iBeacon device is not available for testing, a second iOS device can be used to simulate an iBeacon, with apps
such as 'Beacon Bits', which are available in the App Store.
